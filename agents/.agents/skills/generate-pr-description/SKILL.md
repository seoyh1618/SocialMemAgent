name: generate-pr-description
description: "Generates pull request descriptions by comparing current branch with parent branch. Creates semantic commit-style PR titles and fills PR templates. Use when the user asks to generate PR description, prepare pull request, or create merge request description. The user may include ticket IDs in the request (e.g. tickets: NN-123, TB-456) from the company tracking system; treat those as the related issue IDs for the PR."

# Generate PR Description

Generate a concise pull request description by analyzing git changes and using the project's PR template.

**Language:** Always generate PR titles and descriptions in **English**, regardless of the user's language or the language of commit messages.

## Workflow

1. **Identify parent branch**
   - Check current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - Determine parent (usually `main` or `master`): `git show-branch | grep '*' | grep -v "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" | head -1 | sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\].*/\1/' | sed 's/[\^~].*//'`
   - Or use: `git merge-base HEAD main` to find common ancestor

2. **Analyze changes**
   - Get diff stats: `git diff --stat <parent-branch>..HEAD`
   - Get commit messages: `git log --oneline <parent-branch>..HEAD`
   - Get file changes: `git diff --name-status <parent-branch>..HEAD`

3. **Generate semantic commit title**
   - Analyze changes to determine type:
     - `feat:` - New features
     - `fix:` - Bug fixes
     - `docs:` - Documentation changes
     - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
     - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
     - `perf:` - Performance improvements
     - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
     - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (deps, config, etc.)
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`
   - Keep title under 72 characters

4. **Load PR template**
   - Check for `.github/pull_request_template.md` first
   - If not found, check `.gitlab/merge_request_template.md`
   - If still not found, use the template in this skill: `templates/pull_request_template.md` (relative to the skill directory)
   - Read the template file

5. **Fill template concisely**
   - Before filling the template, group all changes by theme/area (e.g. auth, API, UI, tests, docs)
   - Do not repeat the same subject: one entry per theme, even if multiple files or commits touch it
   - Extract key changes from git diff and commits, already grouped by theme as above
   - Fill "Changes Description" using the template’s two-level structure:
     - **Level 1 (category):** one top-level bullet per theme/area (`{level1_changes_description_category}`)
     - **Level 2 (sub-details):** one or more sub-bullets under each category for distinct sub-changes (`{level2_change_detail_for_that_category}`); omit sub-bullets when a category has only one simple change
   - Keep each bullet point brief (one line when possible)
   - Use emojis sparingly (🚧 for WIP, ✅ for done, etc.)
   - Mark checklist items appropriately:
     - **Documentation:** check the box if the PR introduces documentation (JSDoc in changed files, or markdown files `.md` detected in the diff).
     - **Tests:** check the box if the PR adds or updates unit tests. Detect test changes using common conventions: file names matching `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`, or paths under `test/`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, or similar directories used by mainstream test runners (do not assume a specific framework such as Jest or Vitest).
   - **Related Issue(s)** – see step 6 below. Leave "Screen capture(s)" as 🚫 if not applicable

6. **Related tickets**
   - **Ticket IDs source:** The user may provide ticket IDs in their request (e.g. "generate PR description, tickets: NN-123, TB-456" or "PR description with NN-123, TB-456"). Treat any such IDs as the company tracking system ticket numbers for this PR. If none were given, **ask the user:** “Ticket IDs for this PR (comma-separated, e.g. `PROJ-123, PROJ-456`). Leave empty if none.”
   - **Parsing:** From the user message, accept ticket IDs in forms like: `tickets: NN-123, TB-456`; `tickets NN-123, TB-456`; or inline project-key numbers (e.g. `NN-123`, `TB-456`). Normalize to a list of trimmed IDs (comma/semicolon/space separated).
   - If one or more IDs are available (from the request or from the user's answer):
     - **Tasks manager base URL:** Run from the **project root** (repo where the PR is created): `node <skill-dir>/scripts/tasks-system.mjs`. The script loads `skills-configs.json` at project root (creates it if missing), prompts for any missing known keys, and outputs the full config as JSON (key/value). Use `configs.tasksManagerSystemBaseUrl` for the base URL of ticket links.
     - For each ticket ID (trimmed), build the link: `{baseUrl}/{ID}`
     - **Description:** If you can get the issue summary (e.g. API or user pastes descriptions), use it as the link text; otherwise use the ticket ID.
     - Fill "Related Issue(s)" with a markdown list, one line per ticket:
       - `- [Description or ID]({baseUrl}/{ID})`
       - Example: `- [Add login screen](https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123)` or `- [PROJ-123](https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123)`
   - If the user leaves the list empty or says “none”, keep "Related Issue(s)" as `- 🚫`.

7. **Enforce 1000 character limit**
   - Count total characters including markdown syntax
   - If over limit, prioritize:
     1. Keep the title
     2. Keep essential change descriptions
     3. Shorten or remove less critical sections
     4. Condense bullet points

8. **Write file, copy to clipboard, remove file**
   - At **PR project root**, create or overwrite `pr-description.md` with the full PR output (complete markdown from "## PR Title" through the end of the description).
   - Call the copy script with the full path to the file: `node <skill-dir>/scripts/copy-to-clipboard.mjs "<full-path-to-pr-description.md>"` (e.g. `$(pwd)/pr-description.md` when run from the PR project).
   - **On success:** remove the file (`rm pr-description.md`) and tell the user: **"The full PR description is in the clipboard; you can paste it into your PR."**
   - **On error:** leave `pr-description.md` in place and tell the user they can open it or copy manually.

## Output Format

Provide ready-to-copy markdown in this format:

```markdown
## PR Title

<semantic-commit-style-title>

## PR Description

<filled-template-markdown including Summary then Changes Description with level-1 bullets (themes) and optional level-2 sub-bullets (sub-changes)>
```

**Grouping rule:** Never list the same subject twice. If several commits or files relate to the same theme (e.g. "auth", "tests", "docs"), merge them into a single level-1 bullet in the summary and in Changes Description; use level-2 sub-bullets only for distinct sub-changes within that theme.

## Example

**Input analysis:**

- Branch: `feature/add-user-auth`
- Changes: Added login component, updated auth service, added tests
- 3 commits: "feat: add login component", "feat: update auth service", "test: add auth tests"

**Output:**

```markdown
## PR Title

feat(auth): implement user authentication

## PR Description

## Summary

- Authentication: login component and auth service.
- Tests: auth-related tests added.

## Changes Description

- **Auth:** login component and auth service.
  - Login component added.
  - Auth service updated.
- **Tests:** auth tests added.

## Checklist

(other checklist items...)
```

## Character Count Tips

- Use abbreviations when appropriate (e.g., "auth" instead of "authentication")
- Combine related changes into single level-1 bullets; use level-2 sub-bullets only when a category has several distinct sub-changes (grouping avoids repetition)
- Remove template placeholders if not needed
- Prioritize Summary and "Changes Description" over other sections
